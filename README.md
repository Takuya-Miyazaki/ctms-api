# CTMS API

This is a work-in-progress for the Contact Management System (CTMS) API.
The API is read-only with some sample test contacts with fake data:

* [93db83d4-4119-4e0c-af87-a713786fa81d](http://ctms-api.api.data.allizom.org/ctms/93db83d4-4119-4e0c-af87-a713786fa81d):
  sample contact with minimal data:
  - email ``ctms-user@example.com``
  - Basket token ``142e20b6-1ef5-43d8-b5f4-597430e956d7``
  - SalesForce ID ``001A000001aABcDEFG``
* [67e52c77-950f-4f28-accb-bb3ea1a2c51a](http://ctms-api.api.data.allizom.org/ctms/67e52c77-950f-4f28-accb-bb3ea1a2c51a):
  sample contact with all data:
  - email ``mozilla-fan@example.com``
  - Basket token ``d9ba6182-f5dd-4728-a477-2cc11bf62b69``
  - SalesForce ID ``001A000001aMozFan``
  - AMO User ID: ``123``
  - Payee ID: ``cust_012345``
* [332de237-cab7-4461-bcc3-48e68f42bd5c](http://ctms-api.api.data.allizom.org/ctms/332de237-cab7-4461-bcc3-48e68f42bd5c):
  - email ``contact@example.com``
  - Basket token ``c4a7d759-bb52-457b-896b-90f1d3ef8433``
  - SalesForce ID ``001A000023aABcDEFG``
  - AMO User ID: ``98765``

Next features for v0.5:

# Based on containerized-microservice-template

[containerized-microservice-template](https://github.com/mozilla-it/containerized-microservice-template)
is a github repo template using python3 with:

 - Using FastAPI framework (Pydantic, Swagger, included)
 - BDD testing strategies (using Gherkin and Behave)
 - Python package control through **poetry**
 - **Pre-commit** for detecting secrets, typing, linting (Detect-Secrets,Mypy, Black)
 - Containerization through **Docker**
 - Build Pipeline through **GCP's Cloudbuild**
 - Deployment yaml's for k8s
